     Due to the persistent interests of Nizamshah, Adilshah and Mughals, 
     the condition of Pune was very bad. Under such adverse circumstances, 
     she redeveloped the city of Pune. She plowed the farmland with a golden plow,
     giving sanctuary to the locals. She was responsible for the education of the kings.
     Jijabai told Shivaji stories from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, which began and ended in independence.
     How mighty was Rama who killed Ravana who was depriving Sita, how mighty was Bhima who killed Bakasura and rescued weak people, etc. 
     Because of these rites given by Jijabai, Shivaji Raje happened. 
     Jijabai not only told the story but also gave the first lessons of politics by sitting next to the chair
